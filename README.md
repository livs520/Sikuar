# Sikuar

Sikuar is a SaaS platform that empowers companies to prevent workplace risks, foster a positive organizational culture, and achieve ESG compliance through anonymous reporting technology and ethical participation traceability. It leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and non-transferable NFTs (soulbound tokens) to ensure privacy and verifiable compliance.

## üõë The Problem Sikuar Solves

- **Silence and fear in the workplace:** Employees hesitate to report harassment, discrimination, or misconduct due to fear of retaliation, job loss, or lack of trust in internal channels. This issue is especially acute in industries with rigid hierarchies or high turnover.
- **False signals in workplace climate reports:** Internal surveys often yield biased or overly positive data, as employees fear being identified or punished. This leads to misleading insights and poor strategic decisions.
- **Reputational and compliance risk:** Without secure, ethical reporting systems, companies face legal claims, loss of talent, diminished workplace trust, and poor ESG or audit scores.
- **No ethical traceability of participation:** Current systems can't prove ethical workforce engagement without compromising privacy. There's no way to tokenize and validate participation in a verifiable, anonymous, and auditable manner.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Sikuar Solves It

- Provides a secure, anonymous reporting and survey platform using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to validate participation without revealing identity.
- Issues **non-transferable NFTs (soulbound tokens)** to confirm survey completion or protocol compliance‚Äîwithout collecting personal data.
- Offers a real-time dashboard for HR and ESG teams with aggregated reports and red flag alerts.
- Enables ethical traceability and measurable compliance aligned with ESG frameworks and privacy standards.
